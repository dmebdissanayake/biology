Biology Resource Books: For G.C.E. (Advanced Level) [Similar to the British Advanced Level]

When we talk about making enthusiasm for biology, though a teacher’s handbook complicity enunciates the limits of the subject by way of the learning outcomes, the teacher’s book only is not sufficient to identify holistically the confines of the facts. Thus emerged a need for a resource newsletter which describes the subject content. This book series comes to you because of an attempt to fulfil that requirement.

This book series offers biology lovers an opportunity to study the relevant subject content within the limits of a curriculum. It also provides both students and teachers with a source of reliable information expected by the curriculum dispensing with seedling information from various print media and extra classes.

This book series authored by specialist subject teachers and university lecturers are presented to you after the approval of the Academic Affairs Board and the Council of the NIE, LK. Thus it can be recommended as a material of high standard.

Hence, The Sri Lankan Advanced Level (A-level), is a General Certificate of Education (GCE) qualification exam in Sri Lanka, similar to the British Advanced Level, conducted annually by the Department of Examinations of the Ministry of Education.
